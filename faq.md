### Why "The White Log"?

Michal is a sailor and every sailor should keep a **log**. We also like _Twin Peaks_ and absolutely love the **Log Lady**.

![Btw, my Log has something important to tell you.](https://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2014/list/30-best-twin-peaks-characters-20141010/items/the-log-lady-20141010/171152/large_rect/1412891439/1401x788-the-log-lady-twin-peaks.jpg)

 The **log** is "**white"** because it's like a blank page, and like **Gandalf the White**, and also because we believe that taking _**white pills**_ is a great way to exist in the world_**:**_

> White pill  
> 1: being aware of a difficult situation or position and having a fighting "can do" attitude and not giving up, plus accomplishing said thing\(s\) within the difficult situation  
>   
> 2: being optimistic, not merely through gut feelings but via having thought about a situation enough to understand how to get through it successfully  
>   
> – Source: [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20pill)

We sort of put these together and – POOF! – **The White Log** appeared.
