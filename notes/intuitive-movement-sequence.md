# Intuitive Movement Sequence

I love to start my day by connecting with my body. It changes everything. However, **I feel resistance towards** [**coercing myself into a rigid exercise routine** ](noncoercive-productivity.md)‚Äì sometimes my body just doesn't feel like a specific type of exercise, and I've noticed that if I force it, I tend to end up dramatically reducing the amount of movement in my life. I guess I'm just a sucker for freedom.

Here's the key insight: 

**I want to move a lot, but** [**it doesn't really matter what kind of movement I engage in**](habit-vs-practice.md)**. I'd rather move intuitively.** And my intuitive movement sequence is **a continuous daily "heartbeat" helping me to bring me back to my body, so I feel like engaging in more forms of movement.**

### Building My Sequence

The idea came from observing Silvia building her own 15m morning movement sequence, which became her exercising tiny habit. It's been working like a charm for her, so I copied a few of the exercises and started to gradually develop my own routine.

In essence, **the sequence is a blend of yoga and strength training inspired by my handstand coaching.** The components change from day to day depending on how I feel. I've decided to start recording my sessions to get tips on how to improve my positions. 

**The absolute, non-negotiable minimum is to do one** [**Sun Salutation**](https://www.verywellfit.com/illustrated-stepbystep-sun-salutation-3567187). This is so little, that I have absolutely no excuse to skip it, no matter how busy or tired I am. While everything else is optional, the truth is that while I start doing it, I actually want to do more.

Here's an example of my full movement sequence:

Funny enough, on that particular day, I went for a run straight after finishing this sequence. That's exactly what I wanted to achieve ‚Äì¬†unlock more movement!

Here's a video from another day when I didn't have much time, and decided to do a bit of meta reflecting on the process.

On that day, the sequence was followed by a bicycle ride and a yoga session.
