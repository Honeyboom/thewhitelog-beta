# Noncoercive Productivity

I started experimenting with a new approach to productivity: **picking the most important step in the moment, rather than executing tasks on a to-do list.**

In practical terms, **every morning** **I decide on one thing to work on during the day according to what I feel in that moment.** I still keep a list of tasks to execute, but it's more of a _list of possibilities_ rather than a list of what I have to do.

I don't have enough data yet to report back, but after a few days it seems like an experiment worth continuing.

I'll report back with more findings.
