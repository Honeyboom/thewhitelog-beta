# Co-writing "Shutdown"

## What is "Shutdown" and what's this project

Shutdown is the working title of a short sci-fi story that I \(Silvia\) and my friend Tasmin are co-writing. In this file I will be documenting our process of collaborative writing in real time in hopes it will be useful for whoever is interested in doing something similar.

### Why are we writing a book together?

#### Tasmin's intentions:

* Has been writing fiction for a long time but never successfully co-wrote with anyone and would like to try
* Wants to explore collaboration, trust, and letting go of creative control
* Wants to write without pressure to publish, just for fun

#### Silvia's intentions:

* Has been writing nonfiction for a long time and wants to explore fiction for creative purposes
* Excited to work with tasmin because of her expertise in fiction
* Curious about the meta: What are ways to create together and build relationships by making things together?

### How this project started and how we're collaborating:

* Tasmin invited Silvia to co-write a story
* We decided on the genre \(sci-fi\) over text messages
* We are meeting face to face once a week on Wednesdays for 1h30 to build foundations \(storyworld, structure, plot coherence, etc.\)
* Then during the week each of us works on writing their individual part of the story
* There are 2 main characters and we each write from one of their POVs, alternating chapters

## Face to face writing sessions â€” Documentation

### Session 2 \(3rd Mar 2021, ~2h\)

We discussed research we made at home, got clearer on the premise and story world details. We defined the basic points of relationship between main characters. We discussed meta: how we want to work, our intentions for writing together, tools to use, when to meet \(once a week\).

#### Character development:

* Defining their relationship with each other
* Defining personalities: traits, values, history
* Physical appearance: we used Pinterest to get inspired by real portraits and chose a few as a starting point

#### World-building:

* Timeline \(When is the story happening? How long after the event that determined the big premise? What is the actual year?\)
* What are the main events that led up to the current time in the story line?
* Where does the story happen in the real world?
* How do the main characters fit in that world?

#### Homework:

* Continue building each of our characters, namely:
  * Core values
  * Personality
  * History and place in the story world

### Session 1 \(24th Feb 2021, ~1h30\)

We mostly brainstormed freely and explored different threads, focusing especially on defining the premise and general idea of the book.

#### Questions we asked each other to get the process started:

* What kind of sci-fi do we want to write?
* How are we going to be writing together?
* What is the main premise of the story?
* Who are the characters and what is the relationship between them?
* What is the message we want to convey?
* What are the dynamics?
* What is the journey/goal that moves the story forward?

#### Homework:

* Research some scientific questions needing to be answered for a coherent story world
* Brainstorm message of the story
* Think about communication tool for co-writing
* Brainstorm working title \("Shutdown"\)
* Brainstorm characters \(character sheets\)
