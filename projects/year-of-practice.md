# Year of Practice

{% embed url="https://yearofpractice.carrd.co" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This course is currently ongoing and therefore not opened for enrollment. We're offering a shorter [Habit Sprint](https://habitsprint.carrd.co) if you're interested in a similar program.
{% endhint %}

### Format

A year-long habit building course, including:

* guide to pick 3 practices to focus for the entire year \(1 per quarter\)
* private onboarding call
* bi-weekly workshops
* asynchronous community of practice
* extra workshops and meetups throughout the year \(created based on the needs of the group\)
* private chat coaching \(for quarter 1\)

### Context

The Year of Practice is a result of over a year of experimentation with habit-building courses in cohorts. **The key idea is to create a dependable, long-term rhythm for relational growth, and grow in iterations based on the individual** **experience of the the ups and downs.**

### Creating the Year of Practice

Towards the end of 2020 we came up with an idea of **a year long program helping conscious creators to stay consistent with the most important life practices,** with a built-in community of practice. After getting initial positive feedback \(we weren't sure if one year commitment is just waaaay to long for people to sign up\) we decided to go ahead and create the program.

We decided to limit the cohort size to 20 people, to provide intimacy and more focus on every participant. The pricing was a result of [optimizing for enough](../notes/less-money-more-freedom.md): €499 per year, or €150 per quarter.

Interestingly, while this is our biggest program so far, it is also the one that took the _least_ amount of time to create. We see it as a result of our extensive experience with habit building, relational growth in small groups, as well as aligning our work with our core values \(rather than making shittone of money\).
